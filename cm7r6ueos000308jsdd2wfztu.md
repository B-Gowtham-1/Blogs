It’s **Day 5** of my DevOps journey, and today I’m **not learning new things** (finally a break! 😌). Instead, I’m **recapping** everything I’ve learned from **Day 1 to Day 4**—because let’s be honest, I might forget things by tomorrow. So, let’s go over all the basics **one more time** in a fun and **super simple** way.

## **Day 1 – What is DevOps? (And Why Should I Care?)** 🤷‍♂️

So, I started with the **big question**—**What is DevOps?** Sounds fancy, right? But here’s the truth:

👉 DevOps is just a way to **make developers and operations teams stop fighting** and work together. Think of it as a **peace treaty** between the people who **write the code** and the people who **run the code**.

👉 It’s all about **speed and automation**—making software **faster**, **less buggy**, and **less stressful**.

💡 **Why do we even need DevOps?**

* Before DevOps: “It works on my machine” 🙄
    
* After DevOps: “It works everywhere” 🚀
    

💡 **DevOps in SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)**  
SDLC is just **a fancy way of saying**:

1. **Plan** the software
    
2. **Write** the software
    
3. **Test** the software
    
4. **Deploy** the software
    
5. **Maintain** the software
    

👉 DevOps helps by **automating** these steps so that software gets released **faster** and with **fewer problems**.

## **Day 2 – Git & GitHub (The Superhero of Code Saving) 🦸‍♂️**

Ever made a mistake in your code and wished for **CTRL+Z**? That’s exactly what **Git** does! It saves **every single change** you make so you can **undo mistakes** and never lose your code again.

💡 **Git Basics** – The Magic Commands ✨

* `git init` → Turns a normal folder into a Git-tracked folder.
    
* `git add` → Adds files to be saved. (Because Git doesn’t trust you automatically.)
    
* `git commit` → Saves the changes with a message (so future you knows what past you did).
    
* `git push` → Uploads the code to GitHub (so you don’t cry if your laptop dies).
    

💡 **GitHub? What’s that?**

* GitHub is a **website where you store your Git-tracked code**.
    
* It’s like **Google Drive, but for code**.
    
* You can **collaborate with others, share your projects, and contribute to open-source.**

## **Day 3 – How Servers & Virtual Machines Work 🖥️**

Now that I can **save my code**, the next question is: **Where does this code actually run?** 🤔

💡 **Servers – The Brains of the Internet**

* A server is **just a big, powerful computer** that runs websites, apps, and databases.
    
* Every time you open a website, **you’re asking a server to send you information.**
    

💡 **Virtual Machines (VMs) – Computers Inside Computers**

* A VM is **a computer running inside another computer**. (Like a dream inside a dream…Inception style! 😵‍💫)
    
* Instead of buying **10 real servers**, companies can create **10 virtual servers** on **one** big machine.
    
* This **saves money, makes scaling easier, and keeps things organized.**

## **Day 4 – Cloud Providers & More Virtual Machines ☁️**

Now that I know how **servers work**, I learned about **Cloud Providers**—the companies that let us **rent** servers instead of buying them.

💡 **Popular Cloud Providers**  
☁️ **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** – The biggest and most popular cloud provider. Used by Netflix, Uber, and almost everyone.  
☁️ **Azure (Microsoft’s Cloud)** – Good for enterprise companies that love Windows.  
☁️ **GCP (Google Cloud Platform)** – Amazing for AI, Big Data, and all things Google-y.

💡 **Why Cloud Instead of Buying a Server?**

* No need to buy and maintain expensive hardware.
    
* **Pay only for what you use** (like a prepaid phone).
    
* If your app suddenly gets **1 million users**, the cloud can handle it!
