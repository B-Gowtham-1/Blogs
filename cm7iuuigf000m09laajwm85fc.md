Deploying Dreams, Debugging Nightmares: My DevOps & Cloud Journey

**Why I'm Doing This**

I’ve always been interested in **DevOps and Cloud**, but every time someone starts explaining Kubernetes, my brain goes on vacation. Instead of watching tutorial after tutorial and forgetting everything, I’m going to *learn by doing* and write about my experience.

Also, if I break something while experimenting, at least it’ll make a good story.

**How I'm Learning**

I’ll be using **Abhishek Veramalla’s** resources, testing things on my own, and hopefully not bringing down entire servers in the process. My goal? Make DevOps and Cloud easy to understand without making my head explode.

**What I'll Be Posting**

* **Explaining DevOps tools & concepts** – In a way that actually makes sense.
    
* **Hands-on projects** – Because theory alone isn’t going to help.
    
* **Best practices & insights** – Aka, what works and what will make you want to throw your laptop.
    
* **Personal struggles & breakthroughs** – Because learning is full of surprises.
    
* **Discussions & collabs** – Let’s build cool stuff and figure this out together!
    

**Join Me!**

If you’re also trying to make sense of DevOps and Cloud, let’s learn together! Share your experiences, ask questions, or just enjoy the chaos.
