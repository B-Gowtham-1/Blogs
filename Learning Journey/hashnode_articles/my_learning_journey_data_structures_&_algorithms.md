# My Learning Journey: Data Structures & Algorithms

**Why I'm Doing This**

So, I finally decided to learn **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** because, it turns out, just writing print(“Hello, world!”) won’t get me a job. DSA is everywhere—interviews, coding competitions, and even those random coding memes I pretend to understand.

Instead of keeping my struggles (and rare moments of success) to myself, I thought—why not share? This way, I can track my progress, help others, and maybe someone will explain recursion to me in a way that actually makes sense.

**How I'm Learning**

I’ll be following **Kunal Kushwaha’s** resources (because he explains things really well) and adding my own notes, weird examples, and some confused ramblings when things get tricky. The goal? Make DSA a little less painful.

**What I'll Be Posting**

* **Breaking down concepts** – So they don’t sound like alien technology.
    
* **Solving coding problems** – Showing my thought process (and my inevitable debugging nightmares).
    
* **Wins & struggles** – Because let’s be real, this won’t be easy.
    
* **Discussions!** – Let’s learn together, share tips, and maybe cry over hard problems.
    

**Join Me!**

If you’re also learning DSA, let’s do it together! Share your thoughts, give feedback, or just sit back and watch me suffer through it.
