# My Learning Journey: DevOps & Cloud

Deploying Dreams, Debugging Nightmares: My DevOps & Cloud Journey

**Why I'm Doing This**

I’ve always been interested in **DevOps and Cloud**, but every time someone starts explaining Kubernetes, my brain goes on vacation. Instead of watching tutorial after tutorial and forgetting everything, I’m going to *learn by doing* and write about my experience.

Also, if I break something while experimenting, at least it’ll make a good story.

**How I'm Learning**

I’ll be using **Abhishek Veramalla’s** resources, testing things on my own, and hopefully not bringing down entire servers in the process. My goal? Make DevOps and Cloud easy to understand without making my head explode.

**What I'll Be Posting**

* **Explaining DevOps tools & concepts** – In a way that actually makes sense.
    
* **Hands-on projects** – Because theory alone isn’t going to help.
    
* **Best practices & insights** – Aka, what works and what will make you want to throw your laptop.
    
* **Personal struggles & breakthroughs** – Because learning is full of surprises.
    
* **Discussions & collabs** – Let’s build cool stuff and figure this out together!

If you’re also trying to make sense of DevOps and Cloud, let’s learn together! Share your experiences, ask questions, or just enjoy the chaos.
