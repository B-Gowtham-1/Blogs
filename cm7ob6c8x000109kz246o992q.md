Alright, today I tackled **arrays** in Java. Sounds simple, right? Just a collection of items, nice and neat. But oh no, Java had to make it **just a little bit more complicated** for us.

---

## **What Even is an Array?**

An array is **basically a list**‚Äîa way to store **multiple values** in a **single variable**. Instead of writing:

```java
int num1 = 10;
int num2 = 20;
int num3 = 30;
```

(Java would love if you suffered like this)

You just do:

```java
int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30};
```

Boom. One line. Clean. Efficient. **No unnecessary pain.**

But don‚Äôt get too excited‚Äîarrays in Java come with **rules**. And Java **loves** its rules.

---

## **Arrays are FIXED in Size (Because Why Not?)**

Java says, **‚ÄúYou must declare the array‚Äôs size beforehand, and you cannot change it later.‚Äù**

```java
int[] numbers = new int[5]; // Array of size 5, nothing more, nothing less.
```

So if you suddenly **need to add a 6th number?** Too bad. Java **won‚Äôt let you**. You‚Äôll have to create a whole new array, copy everything over, and then add your new value. Because Java believes in **making us work harder.**

---

## **How to Access Elements in an Array?**

Java has this wonderful thing called **indexing**, where the first element starts at `0` (not 1, because that would be too logical).

Example:

```java
int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

System.out.println(numbers[0]); // Prints 10 (first element)
System.out.println(numbers[2]); // Prints 30 (third element)
```

Try accessing something **outside the array‚Äôs range**, and Java will **explode** with an **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException** because Java loves **reminding us of our mistakes**.

---

## **Changing Values in an Array**

Want to replace an element? Easy. Just **assign a new value** to an index.

```java
numbers[1] = 100; // Changes the second element from 20 to 100
```

Now, the array is `{10, 100, 30, 40, 50}`. Simple, right?

---

## **Looping Through an Array (Because We Are Not Cavemen)**

Imagine manually printing each element‚Ä¶ yeah, no. That‚Äôs where **loops** save our sanity.

### **The Classic For Loop**

```java
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}
```

This prints all the elements **without** making you suffer.

### **The For-Each Loop (For When You‚Äôre Feeling Lazy)**

```java
for (int num : numbers) {
    System.out.println(num);
}
```

This is like telling Java:  
*"Hey, just print each number. You figure out the details."*  
Java does it. No questions asked.

---

## **Types of Arrays (Because One Wasn‚Äôt Enough)**

### **String Array (For Names and Words)**

```java
String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};
```

### **Character Array (For Individual Letters)**

```java
char[] vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};
```

### **Boolean Array (For True/False Values)**

```java
boolean[] flags = {true, false, true};
```

### **Double Array (For Decimal Numbers)**

```java
double[] prices = {10.99, 20.50, 30.75};
```

Because Java believes in **variety.**

---

## **Multidimensional Arrays ‚Äì Arrays Inside Arrays (Why, Java? Just Why?)**

Because one array wasn‚Äôt annoying enough, Java lets you have **arrays inside arrays.**

```java
int[][] matrix = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
System.out.println(matrix[1][2]); // Prints 6 (row 1, column 2)
```

Why would you need this? I don‚Äôt know. But it exists.

---

## **Common Mistakes in Arrays (Because Learning Isn‚Äôt Fun Without Errors)**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Forgetting Arrays Start at 0**

```java
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30};
System.out.println(arr[3]); // ERROR! Java yells at you.
```

‚úÖ **Solution:** **Always** check `.length` before accessing indexes.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Trying to Change Array Size (Haha, Nope)**

```java
int[] numbers = new int[5];
numbers[5] = 100; // ERROR! Arrays are fixed size.
```

‚úÖ **Solution:** Use an **ArrayList** instead (but that‚Äôs for another day).

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Thinking** `=` Copies Arrays (Spoiler: It Doesn‚Äôt)

```java
int[] a = {1, 2, 3};
int[] b = a;
b[0] = 99;
System.out.println(a[0]); // Prints 99 (Wait, what?!)
```

Arrays in Java don‚Äôt make copies‚Äîthey **share memory**. Change one, and the other **changes too**.

---

## **Why Use Arrays?**

‚úÖ Store **multiple values** without multiple variables  
‚úÖ Organize data **neatly**  
‚úÖ Loop through elements **easily**  
‚úÖ Use them for **sorting, searching, and processing data**

But also...  
‚ùå Can‚Äôt change size  
‚ùå Java yells at you for going out of bounds  
‚ùå Multidimensional arrays exist for some reason

---

## **Final Thoughts**

Arrays in Java are powerful, **but also kind of annoying**. The key takeaway? **Think of them as numbered lockers‚Äîyou can store things, retrieve them by their number, but you can‚Äôt magically add more lockers.**

And that‚Äôs **Day 3** of my DSA journey! üéâ  
Now time to solve **array problems** (and question my life choices).
